# SOC Project Name : Making an E-Commerce Website using Django

I was working on this project for nearly 3 months starting from April end.
In the initial phase when the project started, mentor wa giving us weekly materials like in the first week he gave material for HTML, CSS, then in the subsequent week Bootstrap, then Python and then finally Django.

The first half of the project where we had to make the website using only frontend was completed on time which was mid May but later on we didn't have any deadline uptil now so I kept postponing the project work and also we were called back to campus in May and then we had our mid-sems, then end-sems so didn't actually get much time  to work on this project until the vacations started.


Coming to the description of all the files that I have created in this project.

app : It is the app created inside this project(python apps)
static : This folder contains all the images that I have used in my Website
